# Scientific-Calculator-C-Sharp
A scientific calculator built using C# Windows Forms. It also includes the functionality to calculate taxes.

----> This is a very basic tax calculator built using C# Windows Forms.
It can carry out all basic tasks of a scientific calculator as well.
Such as sin, cos, tan, power, sqrt, +, - , * , / , Log base 10,
natural log etc.


----> This project can be used for simple mathematical calculations 
just like the ones you do with your physical handheld calculators.
On top of that you can calculate tax figures for different sums.
The percentage for the taxes can vary country to country & region to
region, hence by modifying a few lines of the code you could personalise
it as per your liking.


----> You can download the project files, modify it however you like & just play
around with it. You can change the front end of the calculator if you please &
you could also modify the back end logic if you like.

----> You guys can get more help on the project by contacting me at

----> At the moment I amthe only one responsible for maintaining &
contributing to the project.
